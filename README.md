# fRequent
I have made the decision not to put this package on CRAN, since it has only personal frequently used functions. I do not want to fill CRAN with this package, but since the functions can also be usefull for other people I have made it available on Github.

The package can be downloaded by running the following code:
```{r}
devtools::install_github(repo="jeroenpullens/fRequent",subdir = "fRequent")
```


Below the status of the automatic Travis CI tests on the master branch (if this doesn load see [here](https://travis-ci.org/jeroenpullens/fRequent))
